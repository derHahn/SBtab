# sbtab_web
Web interface for SBtab project (web2py)

--

If you want to use the SBtab online interface on your own local server, you will need the Python3 version of the web2py framework. It can be found on the [web2py homepage](http://www.web2py.com) or directly on the corresponding [web2py Github page](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/).

With the files and information provided on the links above, you will be able to set up your local web2py server. Next, you can add the SBtab application from this Github directory into a folder web2py/applications/sbtab. After starting the web2py server, you will find the SBtab application by default on http://127.0.0.1:8000/sbtab, if not specified otherwise.
